### What is the Serverless Framework?

The Serverless Framework is an open-source toolkit that empowers developers to build and deploy applications on cloud platforms without the need to manage server operations. By handling the underlying server infrastructure, it allows developers to concentrate on coding and feature development, boosting productivity and efficiency. The framework is compatible with multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, offering a flexible and scalable solution for contemporary application development. With its robust plug-ins and strong community support, the Serverless Framework streamlines complex deployment workflows, encourages best practices, and supports rapid iteration, making it a vital tool in the DevOps ecosystem.

In the previous [Learning Path](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/serverless-framework-aws-lambda-dynamodb/), you learned how to set up the Serverless Framework for AWS and to deploy two AWS Lambda functions that consume data from DynamoDB. For more tutorials about running IoT applications by manually creating various AWS resources, please review the following learning paths:
1. [Use Amazon DynamoDB for your IoT applications running on Arm64](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_dynamodb).
2. [Use AWS Lambda for IoT applications running on Arm64](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_lambda).
3. [Integrate AWS Lambda with DynamoDB for IoT applications running on Windows on Arm](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_lambda_dynamodb).

Although manual resource provisioning has certain advantages, it can become increasingly challenging as you deploy applications to the cloud. As your solutions expand and grow in complexity, the difficulties of manual provisioning multiply. This is where the Serverless Framework becomes valuable, providing a streamlined and efficient method for managing cloud resources.

In this learning path, you will learn how to extend the previous example through a website that interacts with AWS Lambda functions and deploy it to an S3 bucket using the Serverless Framework. This is similar to what you learned in this [Learning Path](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_s3).
